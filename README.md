===========

akkaSniffer is a message sniffer for akka. I.e it protocols any message sent from one actor to another actor. It also traces which actor creates which other actor.

For the visualzation part, the product <a href='http://www.visual-paradigm.com/'>Visual Paradigm</a> is used. The reason for this is, that there is an easy plug-in api and there is also a free community edition available.
